Assignment 1-Data Structures (2028C)
Topics covered: Sorting
 

Objective:
The objective of this homework is to investigate different sorting algorithms.

Scenario:
In this assignment, we are going to be investigating the actual performance of different sorting methods.  Additionally, we will implement 1 sorting method on a linked list.  This needs to be written using C++.

Requirements:
1.	Create a program that generate an array of sizes n= 10, 100, 500, 5000 and 25000 items.  Your program should populate those arrays with randomly generated integers with a value between 0 and the 2n where n is the size of the array.  Create an implementation for the following sort operations.
a.	Bubble sort
b.	Insertion sort
c.	Merge-sort
d.	Quicksort
e.	Heap-sort
f.	Counting sort
g.	Radix-sort

2.	Test each of the sort operations and record the time the sort takes to complete.  You should test each on the same unsorted array to get the best comparison.  You should do this for each array size (from requirement 1) a minimum of 10 times.  Your test should use the chrono libraryâ€™s high_resolution_clock class.  The following example of how to do this in nanoseconds is found on Stack Overflow.  Only the time in the 7 sort functions should be measured.

1.	#include <iostream>
2.	#include <chrono>
3.	typedef std::chrono::high_resolution_clock Clock;
4.	
5.	int main()
6.	{
7.	    auto t1 = Clock::now();
8.	    auto t2 = Clock::now();
9.	    std::cout << "Delta t2-t1: " 
10.	        << std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::nanoseconds>(t2 - t1).count()
11.	        << " nanoseconds" << std::endl;
12.	}

Use the output of this to make a table similar to (these numbers are completely fabricated) the following with the values showing the average of all your runs for this test type:

	10	100	500	5000	25000
Bubble sort	10 ms	1000 ms	25004 ms	2500312 ms	> 5 minutes
Insertion sort	11 ms	708 ms	45646 ms	98984 ms	98798797 ms
Merge-sort	50 ms	652 ms	44646 ms	Ran out of memory	Ran out of memory
Quicksort	42 ms	753 ms	88544 ms	990090 ms	Ran out of memory
Heap-sort	39 ms	889 ms	7557 ms	80008 ms	8888889 ms
Counting sort	101 ms	656 ms	3355 ms	99665 ms	8889898 ms
Radix-sort	512 ms	1101 ms	2002 ms	77757 ms	7747474 ms

If any 1 test run takes longer than 5 minutes, you may discontinue that test and record that the time took longer than 5 minutes.  Likewise, should any test crash due to running out of memory, record that as well.  Graph this data and explain how well or poorly it matches your expectations for performance given the known Big O notation for the given sort algorithms.  Include what you expected for time for each of the array sizes based on the results for array size of 10.

3.	Create a linked list class that can store Student information.  The Student information must include First Name, Last Name, MNumber and may include any other additional information you wish.  In addition to any required members to make the linked list work, include 3 of the above sort algorithms to support sorting by First Name, Last Name and MNumber (each algorithm sorts by 1 of the 3) and includes a parameter for ascending or descending.  Seed your linked list with data for 50 students that will result in a different order for each of the fields.  Include a menu interface that allows the user to select the sort method and direction and will display the sorted students on the screen.
